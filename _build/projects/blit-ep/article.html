<h2>BLIT EP</h2>
<time datetime="2014-06-01"></time>
<p>This is a noise music EP</p>
<p>It's mostly samples of me playing the kalimba, distorted to hell with audaciy. All of the songs are named after things in the short story series BLIT by David Langford.</p>
<p>You can download it <a href="/stuff/blit.zip">here.</a></p>
