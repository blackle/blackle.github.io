<h2>The A4 Paper Trick</h2>
<time datetime="2015-06-03"></time>
<p>This is a cute little mathematical trick I came up with in my 1st year of undergrad. By simply folding a sheet of A4 paper a certain way you can find an upper and lower bound for the square root of two.</p>

<p>The core of this trick depends on a special property of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#A_series">A paper standard</a>. The long side of an A-type sheet of paper is exactly <img src="./img/sqrt2.png" class="inline" alt="sqrt(2)" \> times the length of the short side. This is so when you cut it in half you get two smaller sheets with the same ratio as the original.</p>
<img class="figure" src="./img/a4_1.png" alt="Ratios of an A series sheet of paper." />
<p>Already we have a good, albeit empirical, lower bound for <img src="./img/sqrt2.png" class="inline" alt="sqrt(2)" \>:</p>
<img class="figure" src="./img/sqrt2gt1.png" alt="A simple lower bound for sqrt(2)." />
<p>Now for our upper bound. First, we fold the short side so it lies flush with the long side, making a crease that goes diagonally.</p>
<img class="figure" src="./img/a4_2.png" alt="Step 1: make a diagonal crease." />
<p>Then using the short edge as a guide, fold the leftovers and flip the whole thing over.</p>
<img class="figure" src="./img/a4_3.png" alt="Step 2: fold the leftovers and flip." />
<p>We're interested in the small isosceles right triangle formed by the leftover section, circled in red. The opposite and adjacent sides are both length <img src="./img/sqrt2minus1.png" class="inline" alt="sqrt(2) - 1" \> and since it is a right triangle we can calculate the area to be:</p>
<img class="figure" src="./img/a4_calc.png" alt="Formula for area of triangle." />
<p>Since we know the triangle exists (citation: we can touch it) this must mean its area is greater than zero. Rearranging the inequality gives us our upper bound:</p>
<img class="figure" src="./img/sqrt2lt1pt5.png" alt="Upper bound for sqrt(2)." />
<p>So all together we have an upper bound and lower bound for <img src="./img/sqrt2.png" class="inline" alt="sqrt(2)" \>. Displayed all nice and together it's:</p>
<img class="figure" src="./img/bounds.png" alt="Upper and lower bound for sqrt(2)." />
<p>Obviously this isn't the "correct" way to compute <img src="./img/sqrt2.png" class="inline" alt="sqrt(2)" \>, for that you'd use newton's method or a faster converging series. What's interesting is the bounds we got are the first two approximations newton's method gives with the initial guess of 1, though this is likely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_Law_of_Small_Numbers">a coincidence</a>. To me this suggests there are more complicated folds that yield smaller&mdash;but demonstrably positive area&mdash;triangles that you can use the greater than 0 trick on to obtain greater accuracy. Unfortunately I've had no luck in finding such folds. Email me if you think of a way!</p>
<p>Now you know a really cool party trick to show all your friends, assuming they like math. If they don't like math you can say you're building the worst paper airplane ever.</p>
