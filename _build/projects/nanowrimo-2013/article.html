<h2>The Light Behind The Stars (NaNoWriMo 2013)</h2>
<time datetime="2013-11-28"></time>
<p>This was my (unfinished) NaNoWriMo 2013 novel. The full title is "the light behind the stars and how dreaming saved our beloved winds."</p>
<p>Essentially it's <i>Snow Crash</i> meets <i>Inception</i> meets this <a href="http://xkcd.com/1276/">xkcd comic<a>. It stars Isabelle (quasi-self insert, its me plus ~15 years), an introspective expert on stochastic map projections and part-time dream expert.</p>
<p>I'm sort of making it up as I go along. More info at <a href="https://github.com/blackle/nano#the-light-behind-the-stars-">its github repo</a>.</p>
