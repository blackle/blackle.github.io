<h2>SideChannel (A Game)</h2>
<time datetime="2015-05-08">Posted on Fri May  8, 2015 by Isabelle Knott</time>
<p>I'm working on a point-and-click adventure game with the working title "SideChannel." Its called SideChannel for a reason, the game must be played partly with an SSH client.</p>

<time datetime="2015-01-27">Posted on Tue Jan 27, 2015 by Isabelle Knott</time>
<p>I've recently been "getting into" the demoscene. Getting into is in quotes because I live in North America and there are no demoparties within 50 km of me, so all I can do is read old Hugi articles and watch videos from pouet.</p>
<p>In the interest of doing something productive, I decided to make my own demo.</p>

<h2>Neon Genesis Evangelion Intro Parody Generator</h2>
<time datetime="2014-12-30">Posted on Tue Dec 30, 2014 by Isabelle Knott</time>
<p>I forgot why I decided to start working on this.</p>
<p>Basically I'm trying to make a webapp that allows users to edit parts of the NGE intro with their own pictures. This involves completely recreating the intro in HTML5 canvas.</p>
<p>Read more for my progress.</p>

<h2>WebGL Myst Game</h2>
<time datetime="2014-10-17">Posted on Fri Oct 17, 2014 by Isabelle Knott</time>
<p>I've been working making a Myst III style game in WebGL for a while now. I made one quite a bit ago that takes place in the middle of some clouds, but it stopped working.</p>
<p>To get a look at the game in it's current state, <a target="_blank" href="/stuff/myst/">click here</a></p>

<h2>BLIT EP</h2>
<time datetime="2014-06-01">Posted on Sun Jun  1, 2014 by Isabelle Knott</time>
<p>This is a noise music EP</p>
<p>It's mostly samples of me playing the kalimba, distorted to hell with audaciy. All of the songs are named after things in the short story series BLIT by David Langford.</p>
<p>You can download it <a href="/stuff/blit.zip">here.</a></p>

<h2>SVG Timer</h2>
<time datetime="2014-04-20">Posted on Sun Apr 20, 2014 by Isabelle Knott</time>
<p>Made a timer app that uses js hooks on embedded SVG. So the app is 100% scalable (in the most literal sense)</p>
<p>Check it out <a href="/stuff/timer">here</a></p>

<h2>Angora Haiku Generator</h2>
<time datetime="2014-03-24">Posted on Mon Mar 24, 2014 by Isabelle Knott</time>
<p>Angora used to be a fairly popular IRC chatroom. In addition to it's many frequents, we also had a bot, named lethargic. Lethargic was written in perl and worked by randomly selecting lines from my ~1MB chatlog file and spitting them back (after a few transformations of course)</p>
<p>Using a perl module that counts syllables, I split this chatlog into two files, one that contains only lines with 5 syllables, and one that contains only lines with 7. These files aren't that big, so I wrote a page that loads them with AJAX and lets you make haikus with them.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="/stuff/haiku/">you can play with it here</a></p>

<h2>Canada Goes to Paris</h2>
<time datetime="2014-01-14">Posted on Tue Jan 14, 2014 by Isabelle Knott</time>
<p>This is the stupidest game I've ever made. This started as a joke in the angora skype group. I said, in a half-asleep daze, that I was playing a game called "canada goes to paris." Clearly such a game does not exist... UNTIL NOW.</p>
<p>To play, <a target="_blank" href="/stuff/canadagoestoparis/">click here</a></p>
<p>There is also a <a target="_blank" href="/stuff/canadagoestoparis/goty_edition.html">game of the year edition</a> (requires chrome)</p>
